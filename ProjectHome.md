Reynardware Incredimail converter will export your Incredimail messages to a .eml format.

### Background ###
My wife was recently using Incredimail email client and I finally convinced her to use Thunderbird. (Now she loves Thunderbird!) I recently found out that there was no way to convert her Incredimail folders to Thunderbird. So, I looked on the web and found a couple of converters which would convert to .eml (then to Thunderbird), but some of them did not work or had to pay money for them. Yuk!

To solve my problem, I spent some time writing this small converter application which takes the latest format of the Incredimail database and converts all the emails to .eml.  This is a freeware application and I am also willing to support it as much as I can.  Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of time so the updates and features will be slow.

See my blog at http://reynardware.blogspot.com/ for all the current news.
